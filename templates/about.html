                The PRTR transfer summary database contains a publicly-available inventory of chemicals or pollutants transferred off-site for disposal, treatment, energy recovery and recycling. It gathers information on which chemicals are transferred, in what quantity, by which industry sector, and the reason for the transfer (see <a href="https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PRTR_transfers_FastAPI">link</a>). A data engineering procedure transforms the information into a standard/generic machine-readable structure for future automation (see <a href="https://github.com/jodhernandezbe/PRTR_transfers">link</a>). The data come from three Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) systems that satisfy the conditions for constructing chemical-based approaches for estimating end-of-life emissions of chemicals. These three PRTR systems are the <a href="http://www.npi.gov.au/">National Pollutant Inventory (NPI)</a>, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/pollution-waste-management/national-pollutant-release-inventory.html">National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program">Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)</a>, which are part of the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/pollutant-release-transfer-register/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a> PRTR that is constructed from OECD member countries.
